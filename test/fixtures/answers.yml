  content: "From what I saw during my trip to Microsoft, most employees were stationed in cubicle-like offices.  They weren't exactly cubicles; instead they were basically 3-4 ft walls in an L-shape around your desk.

two:
  content: "For the most part there is some flexibility with working hours, as long as they are not outrageous.  I heard some employees coming in around 6 or 7 to avoid traffic, and others coming in as late as 10 am. This would probably vary from team to team.  Also, there is an emphasis on working together in your project teams, so getting face-time with co-workers is probably important."
